You can add a new group using [Menu](menu.md?menu) **Edit**, or using a button on the [Toolbar](menu.md?toolbar)

In the group editing window, you can add, change and delete groups. The changed data is highlighted in the list of bold.

All actions are performed with the appropriate buttons. All changes are fixed only after pressing the button **OK**

It is impossible to remove the non-empty group. To removing the non-empty group move numbers from it another group (or to erchive), and only then - remove the group.
