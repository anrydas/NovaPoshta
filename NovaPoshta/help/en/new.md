![New](../images/new.png)

In the Adding new Number window, you must provide:
- Number type (inbound, outbound, undefined)
- sender's or recoiver's phone number
- Group
- user comment
- is the auto-update need or not

If you plan to add another Number then you can choose **Add another** then the window after adding the current Number will not be closed.

At the same time, several windows of adding a new Number can be opened. If the **Adding new Number window** is still open when the application is closing, the application will not be closed, but will propose to close the **Adding new Number windows**.
